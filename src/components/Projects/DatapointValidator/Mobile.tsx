            While working at a print shop, Iâ€™d had enough of the tedious manual
            labor that was tracking down client design files across our storage
            system. It was slow, repetitive, and prone to human error â€” so I
            decided to automate it.
          </p>
          <p>
            We often received massive spreadsheets from clients, listing
            hundreds or even thousands of requested designs. Our job was to
            manually search the file server row-by-row, find matching designs,
            and report back which ones could be completed quickly.
          </p>
          <p>
            Knowing the rough file structure of our office server, I wrote a
            script that scanned the spreadsheet values and searched for them in
            the server automatically. This drastically cut down the time spent
            on each job and reduced mistakes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since this was my first tool used in day-to-day operations, I wanted
            it to last. I researched efficient approaches to ensure it stayed
            fast even as the file server grew in size. I eventually implemented
            a two-pass map strategy to optimize lookups.
          </p>
          <p>
            For the interface, I kept things simple: a server-side rendered app
            using EJS as the templating engine. The app cleanly displayed which
            designs were found and which were missing â€” no complex frontend
            needed.

            {tags.map((tag) => (
              <span key={tag} className="tag">
                {tag}
              </span>
            ))}
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
