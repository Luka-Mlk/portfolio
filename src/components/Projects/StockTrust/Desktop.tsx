          <p>
            Stocktrust started as a Software Design & Architecture course
            assignment to scrape the Macedonian Stock Exchange and analyze its
            historical data with trading indicators.
          </p>
          <p>
            I used Go for backend development, leveraging the gocolly scraping
            library. Since gocolly does not execute JavaScript, I
            reverse-engineered the siteâ€™s API calls and replicated them with
            custom fetch requests to collect accurate historical data.
          </p>
          <p>
            To handle data efficiently, I built an ETL pipeline that scrapes
            concurrently across multiple threads, queues the results, and writes
            them to a PostgreSQL database.
          </p>
          <p>
            The project architecture was refactored from a monorepo into a
            microservices setup consisting of three services: a frontend
            renderer, a scraper, and a data communication service serving as an
            entrypoint for the renderer to get data.
          </p>
          <p>
            For deployment, I created Dockerfiles for all services and combined
            them into a Docker Compose setup, which also runs PostgreSQL and an
            Nginx server responsible for routing requests.
          </p>
          <p>
            For more details, feel free to check out the repository, which
            includes a tutorial on running the project and configuring the
            Docker containers.
