            TicketBlaster was built as the final project for the full-stack
            development program I completed at Semos Education. After 9 months
            of hands-on learning, this app was meant to sum everything up into a
            real-world application.
          </p>
          <p>
            The goal was to build a Ticketmaster-style app with user accounts,
            admin dashboards, ticket history, and session persistence ‚Äî all
            built using the MERN stack.
          </p>
          <p>
            A unique challenge was implementing a custom proxy server in Node.js
            to route traffic between services. This became necessary to satisfy
            the project requirement for a proxy and gave me valuable experience
            working with low-level HTTP routing and middleware.
          </p>
          <p>
            Due to some issues with cross-platform service management on
            Windows, I introduced PM2 as a process manager to ensure all
            services booted as seperate services
          </p>
          <p>
            The frontend was my first large-scale React project, and it greatly
            improved my understanding of component architecture, state
            management, and API integration.
          </p>
          <p>
            TicketBlaster uses MongoDB as its primary data store ‚Äî being my
            first hands-on experience with NoSQL databases, including modeling,
            indexing, and querying with Mongoose.
